/**
 * Component used for checking role-based ACL in Vaadin Endpoints.
 * <p>
 * For each request that is trying to access the method in the corresponding
 * Vaadin Connect Endpoint, the permission check is carried on.
 * <p>
 * It looks for {@link AnonymousAllowed} {@link PermitAll}, {@link DenyAll} and
 * {@link RolesAllowed} annotations in endpoint methods and classes containing
 * these methods (no super classes' annotations are taken into account).
 * <p>
 * Method-level annotation override Class-level ones.
 * <p>
 * In the next example, since the class is denied to all, method1 is not
 * accessible to anyone, method2 can be executed by any authorized used, method3
 * is only allowed to the accounts having the ROLE_USER authority and method4 is
 * available for every user, including anonymous ones that don't provide any
 * token in their requests.
