## Description

Vertx Vaadin is an adapter library that lets you run [Vaadin](https://vaadin.com/) applications on top of [Vert.x](http://vertx.io/).
This means you can mix the simplicity and robustness of Vaadin applications with the powerful tools provided by Vert.x, such as event bus, clustering, High Availability and Fail-Over.
