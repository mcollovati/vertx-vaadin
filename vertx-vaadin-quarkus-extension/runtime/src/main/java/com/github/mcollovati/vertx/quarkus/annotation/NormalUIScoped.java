/**
 * The lifecycle of a UIScoped component is bound to a browser tab.
 * <p>
 * Injecting with this annotation will create a proxy for the contextual
 * instance rather than provide the contextual instance itself.
 * <p>
 * When using proxies, be aware that it's not guaranteed that the hashcode or
 * equals will match when comparing a proxy to it's underlying instance. It's
 * imperative to be aware of this when (for example) adding proxies to a
 * Collection.
 * <p>
 * You cannot use this scope with Vaadin Components. Proxy Components do not
 * work correctly within the Vaadin framework, so as a precaution the Vaadin CDI
 * plugin will not deploy if any such beans are discovered.
 * <p>
 * The sister annotation to this is the {@link UIScoped}. Both annotations
 * reference the same underlying scope, so it is possible to get both a proxy
 * and a direct reference to the same object by using different annotations.
