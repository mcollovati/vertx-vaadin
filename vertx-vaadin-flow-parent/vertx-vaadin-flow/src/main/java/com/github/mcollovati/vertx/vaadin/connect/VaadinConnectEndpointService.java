/**
 * The service that is responsible for processing Vaadin Connect requests.
 * Each class that is annotated with {@link Endpoint} gets its public methods
 * exposed so that those can be triggered by a correct POST request, including
 * the methods inherited from the other classes, excluding {@link Object} class
 * ones. Other methods (non-public) are not considered by the controller.
 * <p>
 * For example, if a class with name {@code TestClass} that has the only public
 * method {@code testMethod} was annotated with the annotation, it can be called
 * via {@literal http://${base_url}/testclass/testmethod} POST call, where
 * {@literal ${base_url}} is the application base url, configured by the user.
 * Class name and method name case in the request URL does not matter, but if
 * the method has parameters, the request body should contain a valid JSON with
 * all parameters in the same order as they are declared in the method. The
 * parameter types should also correspond for the request to be successful.
 *
 * @param <REQUEST>  type of the request which triggers the endpoint call
 * @param <RESPONSE> type of the response container
 * @param <CTX>      type of the processing context carrying request data
