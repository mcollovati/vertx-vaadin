/**
 * The lifecycle of a NormalRouteScoped bean is controlled by route navigation.
 * <p>
 * Every NormalRouteScoped bean belongs to one router component owner. It can be
 * a {@link Route @Route}, or a {@link RouterLayout}, or a
 * {@link HasErrorParameter HasErrorParameter}. Beans are qualified by
 * {@link RouteScopeOwner @RouteScopeOwner} to link with their owner.
 * <p>
 * Until owner remains active, all beans owned by it remain in the scope.
 * <p>
 * You cannot use this scope with Vaadin Components. Proxy Components do not
 * work correctly within the Vaadin framework, so as a precaution the Vaadin CDI
 * plugin will not deploy if any such beans are discovered.
 * <p>
 * The sister annotation to this is the {@link RouteScoped}. Both annotations
 * reference the same underlying scope, so it is possible to get both a proxy
 * and a direct reference to the same object by using different annotations.
